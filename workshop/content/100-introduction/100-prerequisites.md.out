## AWS Account

**Permissions**: In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account, and an AWS IAM user in that account with at least full permissions to the following AWS services:

- AWS IAM
- Amazon S3
- Amazon SageMaker
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon Lex
- Amazon Personalize

**Limits** Please ensure you have following quotas for EC2 set in your account:

- Running On-Demand P3 hosts : 1
- Running On-Demand C5 hosts : 2
- Running On-Demand M5 hosts : 2

You can check your current account quotas, using the ["service quotas"](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas), then navigate to EC2 in the dashboard.

**Use Your Own Account**: The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another person, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around these by appending a unique suffix to the resources that fail to create due to conflicts, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organizationâ€™s account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

**Costs**: Some, but NOT all, of the resources you will launch as part of this workshop are eligible for the AWS free tier if your account is less than 12 months old. See the [AWS Free Tier page](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) for more details. An example of a resource that is **not** covered by the free tier is the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance type used in some workshops. To avoid charges for endpoints and other resources you might not need after you've finished a workshop, please refer to the [**Cleanup Guide**](./CleanupGuide/README.md).

## AWS Region

Some services are not available in all AWS Regions at this time, thus creating the workshop resources in another region might cause issues.
For this workshop, we'll use **us-east-1, North Virginia**, and you should create all of the resources for this workshop there!

Make sure you select your region from the dropdown in the upper right corner of the AWS Console before getting started.
